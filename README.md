_A simple list of projects that are of interest to LEAs_

These are of interest to us because they are developing tools or contain information we recomend to consider. 
In some instances, we actively support and contribute to these projects.


## Artificial Intelligence
### Deepfakes
- [Cleverhans](http://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) - AI aided image processing can be fooled by specific paterns. Criminals might want to exploit this weaknes. Cleverhans helps assess what TensorFlow image classification systems are vulnerable to. Cleverhans pyhton scripts will help benchmark.

### Natural Language Processing
- [Awesome NLP](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp) - An inventory of Natural Langauge Processing resources.

### Machine Learning
- [Cogment](https://docs.cogment.ai) - A high-efficiency framework designed to enable the training of models in environments where humans and agents interact with the environment and each other continuously. It’s capable of distributed, multi-agent, multi-model training.

### Datasets
